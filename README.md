# Imbalance_Class_Optimizer
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that implements a custom cost-sensitive Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch. It features a "smart imputation" system for messy datasets and compares algorithm-level weighting against data-level resampling (SMOTE) to solve binary class imbalance.
